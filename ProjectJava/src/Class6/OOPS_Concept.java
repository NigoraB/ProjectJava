     * 1. Encapsulation:
     *      Wrapping up the code in a single unit(class).
     *
     * 2. Abstraction:
     *      Hiding unnecessary information from the user.
     *
     * 3. Inheritance:
     *      -> parent-class relationship between two classes
     *      -> to achieve, we use "extends" keywords with the child class
     *      -> a class can extend only 1 class (why? - Diamond Problem)
     *          a class can have only 1 parent
     *
     * 4. Polymorphism:
     *      -> same name but different forms (methods with same name but different forms)
     *      -> Types:
     *          1. Compile Time Polymorphism (Static Binding or Method Overloading)
     *          2. Run Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding or Method Overriding)
     *
     * Compile Time polymorphism:
     *      In A class, we have two or more methods with same name but different arguments.
     *      Ways to set different arguments:
     *          a) different no. of arguments
     *          b) different datatype of arguments
     *          c) different sequence of arguments
     * Note: Return type DO NOT play any role in compile-time polymorphism.
     *
     * Run Time Polymorphism:
     *      This can be achieved only in Inheritance type set-up (two classes with parent-child relationship)
     *      When we have methods with same signature in parent-class as well as in child-class
